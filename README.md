## Brief Description

PhosMap emerges as an all-encompassing bioinformatic framework meticulously architected to bestow researchers with a harmonious and interactive data analysis experience within the domain of MS-based phosphoproteomics. Its core essence revolves around catering to label-free phosphoproteomics data procured through data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry. Notably, PhosMap seamlessly accommodates preprocessed data originating from either Mascot integrated in Firmiana or Andromeda derived from MaxQuant. Serving as a versatile and user-friendly platform, PhosMap extends its prowess through a trifecta of deployment options: a web server, a local graphical interface, and an R package. For users without bioinformatics skills, the web server is suitable for analyzing small data volumes. When dealing with larger data volumes, it is recommended to utilize the local graphical interface of PhosMap. Meanwhile, for users with programming skills, the locally installed graphical interface allows for convenient customization and expansion. Moreover, the PhosMap R package offers a highly flexible platform for advanced analysis.


The PhosMap web server can be accessed at the following URL: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Bio-Add/PhosMap.

<p id="how-to-install"></p>

## How to install
To fully unleash the potential of PhosMap, we recommend users to utilize the local version.
There are two different ways to launch PhosMap:

<p id="installdocker"></p>

### 1. Docker-based installation
We provide a docker image with PhosMap: https://hub.docker.com/r/liuzandh/phosmap

Pull the docker image of PhosMap:
```linux
docker pull liuzandh/phosmap:1.0.0
```
Create a docker container containing PhosMap:

```linux
docker run  -p HostPort:3838 liuzandh/phosmap:1.0.0
```
Then, you can enter PhosMap by visiting `HostIP:HostPort`.

For example: HostPort could be set to 8083. This parameter can be changed according to user needs. 
such as,
```linux
docker run -p 8083:3838 liuzandh/phosmap:1.0.0
```
Next, open `127.0.0.1:8083` in the local browser or `remotely access ip:8083` (you should ensure that the machine can be accessed remotely).

### 2. R-based installation

This tool is developed with R, so if you want to run it locally, you may do some preparatory work:
- [1] **Install R.** You can download R from here: https://www.r-project.org/.
- [2] **Install RStudio.** You can download RStudio from here: https://www.rstudio.com/.
- [3] **Download the source code from github.**
- [4] **Download the necessary data.**
  <img src="www/unzip.jpg" width=18% align="right">
  Please download "PhosMap_datasets.zip" from https://github.com/liuzan-info/PhosMap_datasets. Using 'git clone' is recommended. If you are not familiar with Git or experience network issues, you may download from <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o3CVRjvCIHnqfY0Bh9X-qw?pwd=7d2k" target="_blank">here</a> instead.  Then unzip this file to phosmap folder like this pic.

- [5] **Check packages.** After installing R and RStudio, you should check whether you have installed these packages ("shiny","shinyjs","shinyBS","shinyWidgets","ggplot2","ggrepel","plotly","colourpicker","ggseqlogo","pheatmap","survminer","survival","zip","stringr","readr","dplyr","DT","png","svglite","ggplotify","bslib","ksea","rmotifx","PhosMap","qpdf","pcaMethods","impute","rrcovNA","e1071","heatmaply"). 

  You can run the codes below to install them:
  ```linux
  if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)){install.packages("BiocManager")}

  BiocManager::install(c("pcaMethods", "impute"))

  install.packages(c("FactoMineR","factoextra","data.table","tidyr","shiny","shinyjs","shinyBS","shinyWidgets","ggplot2","ggrepel","plotly", "colourpicker","ggseqlogo","pheatmap","survminer","survival","zip","stringr","dplyr","DT","png", "svglite","ggplotify","bslib","qpdf", "rrcovNA", "e1071", "heatmaply", "ggdendro))

  install.packages('devtools')
  require(devtools)

  install_github('evocellnet/ksea')
  install_github('ecnuzdd/PhosMap')

  remove.packages('uwot')
  remove.packages('Matrix')
  devtools::install_version('uwot', version='0.1.14')
  ```
- [6] **click "Run App".** View the file ui.R, then just click button "Run App", Phosmap will start.

<p id="contributing"></p>

## Contributing 
The data input/output (IO) stream adhering to the PhosMap standard ensures the scalability of the functionality. Although we have already included well-established phosphoproteomics methods, there are still many algorithms being continuously developed, and therefore, we appreciate your valuable contributions! 

Please feel free to submit a pull request, and we will respond promptly to review and merge it.
